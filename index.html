Welcome to my personal website! My name is Samuel Martin Frias, you can find me under <em>@samumartinf</em> in most social media. Currently embracing challenges and opportunities as a <strong>Solutions Architect</strong> and <strong>pre-sales Engineer</strong> at <strong><a href="https://wwww.orchestrade.com" target="_blank">Orchestrade</a></strong> Fintech company focusing on providing the best Front to Back portfolio and risk management system. With a dynamic role that sits at the intersection of technology and client engagement, I specialize in devising and delivering innovative solutions that address complex business needs.

<br><br>
My journey into the world of engineering began with a profound interest in Mathematical Modelling, Biology, Finance, and Programming â€” interests that I've nurtured and developed throughout my academic and professional career. I hold an MEng in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London, a background that has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical skills and a problem-solving mindset.
