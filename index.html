Fintech company focusing on providing the best Front to Back portfolio and risk
management system. With a dynamic role that sits at the intersection of
technology and client engagement, I enjoy the cooperative process of building
systems that work and require minimal effort from both parties.

<br /><br />
My journey into the world of engineering began with a profound interest in
Mathematical Modelling, Biology, Finance, and Programming â€” interests that I've
nurtured and developed throughout my academic and professional career. I hold an
MEng in Biomedical Engineering from Imperial College London, a background that
has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical skills and a problem-solving
mindset.

and the exciting journey ahead.
