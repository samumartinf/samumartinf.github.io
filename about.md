# About me
Engineering student with a soft spot for Mathematical Modelling, Finance, reading other boring stuff. Currently living in London and soon to graduate from Imperial College London in June 2020 with an MEng in Biomedical Engineering. 

Here some of my proudest work while in uni:
* Co-founding the [Algorithmic Trading Society](https://www.algosoc.com) currently the biggest academic society in Imperial College with 600+ students
* Creating and running [Algothon](https://www.algothon.org)  for 2 years in a row. The biggest student run algorithmic trading competition in Europe.
* Creating a baby buggy for visually impaired parents. Using sensors and cameras to guide them through the city life.

* Learning how to create iOS apps with implemented computer vision algorithms (one of which used for the baby buggy project) 
* Helping run some of the societies that make life at Imperial as truly wonderful. In my case: Vice President of the Investment Society (two years) and Industrial Liaison for the Bioengineering society. 
* Winning [IC Health Hack](https://www.healthhack.org) developing a VR game accompanied by hardware customisations and progress analytics to support children with Cystic Fibrosis with their exercises. [Phlegm Buster: Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/phlegm-buster)
